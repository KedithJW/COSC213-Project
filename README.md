# Project Task Manager

### Members:

### Description:
We created a Trello-like app that serves as a helpful tool for a variety of different uses, from keeping track of personal to-do's, to working collaboratively on large projects with many members. A secure login page leads to the user's personal dashboard where a list of boards are conveniently displayed. Clicking on a board takes the user to a new page that displays that board's tasks, organized into specified cards. User's are owners of the boards they create and they can also invite other user's to join their boards as members.

### Instructions:
--Detailed instructions on how to set up the development environment, create the database (include the .sql schema file), and run the application locally.--

### Credentials:
--Credentials for a pre-made admin/demo user account.--
